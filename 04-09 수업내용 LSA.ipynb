Questions to Israelis\\nOrganization: Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio (USA)\\nLines: 38\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: thor.ins.cwru.edu\\n\\n\\n   Although I realize that principle is not one of your strongest\\npoints, I would still like to know why do do not ask any question\\nof this sort about the Arab countries.\\n\\n   If you want to continue this think tank charade of yours, your\\nfixation on Israel must stop.  You might have to start asking the\\nsame sort of questions of Arab countries as well.  You realize it\\nwould not work, as the Arab countries' treatment of Jews over the\\nlast several decades is so bad that your fixation on Israel would\\nbegin to look like the biased attack that it is.\\n\\n   Everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid 'Center for\\nPolicy Research' is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigot\\nwho hates Israel.\""

scientists used incomplete copy which allowed animals live longer some transgenic animals developed scaling wart like tumors their necks backs other transgenic mice developed thickened crusting skin lesions that covered most their bodies resembling psoriasis humans skin lesions developed their normal transgenic littermates studies tissue taken from wart like skin tumors showed that they were type noncancerous tumor called papilloma although papillomavirus cause these skin lesions laboratory tests showed sign that virus animals tissue samples taken from sick mice throughout study revealed

better rendered dynamic equivalence shame lord such thing there those that definition good whatever happens want that then statement that good meaning simply says that does what wants that being case either love obey because good only motive left obeying that powerful just makes sense obey dictator even when tells round jews exterminate them because defy might chamber yourself makes sense obey because power punish this ethical theory take radical contradiction genesis christianity general theory that makes moral judgements worthless makes further discussion morality goodness meaningless however does follow that moral judgements always infallible particular cases still less judgements particular cases about course action most likely achieve good result when read scriptural accounts actions history those actions often seem very different from what might expect loves desires what best moreover leaving scriptures aside considering natural world find that nature often very different from what might those believe that author nature also author scriptures must expect find scriptures same sort difficulties that they find nature that some such difficulties should exist itself argument against existence power wisdom goodness contrary their absence would such argument suppose that watching bobby fisher play chess suppose that every time makes move find myself nodding saying good move just what expecting same move would have made were playing that would sign that fisher better chess player than myself given that better expect that least some moves will have thinking what suppose induced that even that real slip just thrown game away similarly understands workings universe better than expected that sometimes will look made mistake difference between fisher chessboard controls universe that chess game fisher wins revise earlier inference that carelessness that made lose queen moves earlier however loses particularly that there time when opportunity checkmate moves take then know that good player thought with other hand shall this life total result some actions therefore grounds judging that have seen move part must always shakier than grounds making similar judgement about fisher book genesis read that joseph older brothers with good reason found insufferable conspired sell into slavery egypt there eventually became viceroy when there famine canaan able provide family when brothers nervously apologized told them worry meant evil turned into good history jews largely history events that look like catastrophes that threaten continued survival religion people both amazingly those events turn saving jews judaism sale joseph brothers looked like breakup family fact ended with reconciliation quarrel between them famine that drove family canaan looked like misfortune them fact they stayed canaan they would almost certainly have intermarried with canaanites been assimilated into their culture their oppression egyptians generations after their arrival egypt again looked like disaster used bring them egypt into promised land here people built temple regularly offered sacrifices babylonians captured jerusalem judea destroyed temple city countryside deported most people babylon might have thought that that would people religion living canaan people been under constant danger assimilation again again they turned from worship lord worship canaanite fertility cults with their ritual prostitution ritual human sacrifice babylonian captivity stop that never again jews show interest polytheism idolatry neither worship canaanites that babylonians ever again foothold among them that judaism been danger becoming simply system sacrifices temple observances only prescribed acts worship consisted coming jerusalem every often offering sacrifice during captivity with temple gone jews invented synagogue place meeting reading study discussion scriptures they came realize clearly what they were danger forgetting while they continued live judea that simply local tribal deity just controller land canaan patron jewish people creator world ruler judge humans everywhere time passed babylonian empire replaced that persians then that greeks rather macedonians ruler antiochus epiphanes determined stamp judaism this made reading study torah punishable death again might think that this would judaism people worship instead reading torah portion appointed they would read some passage from prophets that similar theme then discuss that before this time torah called five books moses genesis exodus leviticus numbers deuteronomy were only books read studied synagogue been antiochus books prophets would probably have been forgotten altogether hatred judaism saved them other examples here omitted brevity sake some remember that julie andrews first became famous eliza doolittle stage production fair lady when warner brothers undertook make movie everyone expected that julie been magnificent stage would play same role movie instead studio decided with established screen star cast audrey hepburn julie andrews naturally crushed later realized that played screen role would have been type cast life elize doolittle type would have been disaster walt disney offered role mary poppins oscar presentation stood there smiling looking walt disney said special thanks made this possible jack warner most memorable line evening similar spirit jews might thank providence have preserved judaism kept alive this beginning with joseph brothers continuing with pharaohs with nebuchadnezzar with antiochus epiphanes after formal meeting broken woman came privately said were talking about holocaust weren answered that example that came your mind then right talking about would talk about everyone everyone bear assume that meant that without holocaust there would have been state israel someone hearing rabbi lecture might leap conclusion that dependent wickedness accomplish purposes least that rabbi thought might then suppose that wickedness fact doing that stirred joseph brothers murderous hate against that when israelites were egypt hardened pharaoh heart that oppressed people would them this raises

feature statue that observers will fortunate sculptor finding piece wood with knot like that just right place presence crowning touch thing that makes statue great work reality knot from being what
