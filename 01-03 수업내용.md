    So I'm super new on everything Spark and I'm pulling my hair out trying to find out why I'm getting this error. This is what I've done so far:
    from pyspark.sql.functions import lit, col, count, sum, when
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
    from pyspark import SparkContext
    no errors there
    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("app1").getOrCreate()
    and I got this gigantic error, I run out of ideas on why this is happening. And just to be clear; my first installation was with Anaconda Navigator and I got the same error! ... any help about this will be greatly appreciated:

    I am newbie in machine learning and just figured out the core principals of gradient descent algorithm, so far I have successfully implemented NNs with single input -> single output, single input -> multiple outputs and multiple input -> multiple outputs (where number of inputs matches number of outputs), but I got stuck with multiple input -> multiple output NNs
    (where number of inputs are greater than number of outputs)
    I tried following, and it adjusts weights to predict correct output, but I am not sure if this is correct way.

    I am developing an application to detect objects based on their colour and variant and send the data to a table in a database.
    With the help of OpenCV module, I can detect the colour on the objects without any issue. But detecting variants is a bit tricky. For instance, I have three variants i.e square, rectangle and circle. How do I detect an object and send the variant data to the Database? 
    I know one of the methods is by drawing contours but I want to know if there's any alternate method like comparing the detected object with the image file (as reference) of the same variant.

    Use pandas.Series.where with str.contains:
    Output:
    I think test substrings is not necessary, only use DataFrame.loc:
    Could you please try following.
    After running above code, value of dataframe will be as follows. np.where could be read for knowing about np.where

    So I have this code which makes text boxes on the pygame screen so that the user can input details. However, as I have multiple boxes on each page I don't know how to make it so that my code returns the inputted value to a different variable name every time (instead of just printing it), which I can then use outside of the class in order to validate the user's input. Furthermore, I am also struggling as my code allows the user to change their input even after pressing enter but I don't want them to be able to do this as after pressing enter the code should validate the input and move to the next screen or display an error message and make the user re-input the details from scratch. This is the code:

    I'm using Windows right now but am interested in the answer for any operating systems.
    I'm writing a program that hashes a large number of files stored on multiple disks, each of which is split into multiple partitions. For example, Disk #1 has partitions C, D, and E, while Disk #2 has partitions F and G, and Disk #3 has partition H.
    I would like to save some time by hashing files in parallel: three threads or processes for the three disks, so 3 files are going at once but only one from each disk. However, I'm not sure how to determine which physical disk a given file is on. (Within my code, that is. I could obviously hardcode it today, but I'm interested in making this re-usable and general.)
    Is this information exposed by the operating system in a way that I can access?

    I want to fetch the rows and delete it. 
    pandas has vectorized string operations, so you can just filter out the rows that contain the string you don't want:
    Another approach (if you have more than one string to filter):

    I'm using Python 3.7 and I have stored a value inside a variable. This variable holds the value of padding which I want to use within curly braces for string formatting. The code explains what I am trying to do.
    This is the code that I have been trying to run. What I am trying to do is to right align the numbers by padding it by the value of the length of the last binary number.
    ValueError: Invalid format specifier
    This is the error I get. What am I doing wrong?
    You must first incorporate the value of the variable length into your format string and, strangely, using .format() is the best way to do it.
    Change the following line
    to
    I usually do it in two steps, creating a format string first. It works by escaping the braces - {{,}} - that need to remain in the format string.
    You can use f-strings.

    I create a invoice dataframe and a number of master dataframes from  csv files 
    I drop a number of rows depending on availability in material masters and customer masters.  I reindex each time. 
    I then need to copy data from the masters to the final, clean Invoice DataFrame.  Instead of doing a for loop over two data frames, I thought I would do a merge on select columns.  
    I end up with 4 extra rows even though I am merging on the left.  I can identify which rows have been repeated.  But I cant identify why.  What am I doing wrong here?
    The merge in your code is equivalent to left outer join. As discussed you have more than one matching keys Cust No for a value of Ship to Party. Remove the duplicate keys in the master dataframe. That might help.
